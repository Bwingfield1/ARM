# Oven Timer on Advanced Risc Machine (ARM) 
For this project I created an oven timer that takes in an input and turns off when timer ends.

First, the user would press the led button, which would turn the led light on. Next, the user is prompted to enter a time for the oven. If the time is valid (in the bounds of 23:59) then the timer will be set. The timer will turn off once the time runs out or if the user double taps the led button.
